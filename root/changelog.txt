Alpha 0.1 (Picking up speed) (」ﾟﾛﾟ)｣

  Dev Note: At some point the all code is going to need restructured, I'll have to compensate for some planned additions. So though the game might not see major addition, it'll hopefully run faster and make it so I can add new content easilier.

I'm wanting to add some minigames, I'm thinking I'll make an infection minigame first where one character is infected and try to get everyone else as well, I'll be designing the map for it soon. Firstly I have to restructure my code so it's more professional and hopefully faster.

I'm thinking about adding a pixelation mode where there is an object you're trying to find, but the closer you get the lower your resolution gets.

AI characters might be a fun experiment in the future, they'd probably be very derpy at first, but that'd be half the fun
