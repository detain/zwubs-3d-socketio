Panic 3D
=

>Panic 3D is a 3D game made with [Three.js](https://threejs.org) and HTML5. This game is based off of a 2D prototype I made. As for what it is, I'm hoping for it to become a Mini-Game Gautlet with Platformer, Shooter Elements, as well as rpg style rankup system. A friending system with chatting will probably be in the future as well, we will have to see.

>Here's a little update, so this is what I'm hoping the game will come to look like as development continues. We'll see how it turns out, and this would probably be with close to the highest settings.

>Hey guys, so I've been very busy recently and won't be able to update the game with any big updates for a little while. I'm currently rewriting most of the code which is taking a while and I've also been crazy busy. I might add some small things such as an online player list, but we'll have to see. I also want to get a game development blog going, but that'll take me some time to create so for now I'll just use this file to give blog style updates.
